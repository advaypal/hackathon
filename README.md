TODO: Find a way to run Python Selenium/other headless browser on heroku to perform image search

Branch master corresponds to unfinished code that allows users to take pictures of movie posters and upload them to the site, which will then identify the movie and scrape relevant data from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes

Branch backup(currently hosted) performs the same scraping function but with movie name as input

Application hosted at https://fathomless-lake-87854.herokuapp.com/

(Can be used on mobile as well)
